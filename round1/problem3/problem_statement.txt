Given an eco-friendly landscape of vegetation including flower and trees, 
determine if a firefly can jump from one stalk to another and reach the end. The stalks are represented as an array,
with the corresponding index representing the position of the stalk. 
Each element in the array represents the maximum jump distance which can be taken from the current position.

input  format

The second line of each test case contains n spaced integers denoting the elements of the array
a.
